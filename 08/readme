le_net.py
Implements the LeNet class with functions for:
Building (_create_lenet()), compiling (_compile()), and training (train()) the CNN model.
Saving (save()) and loading (load()) the trained model.
Predicting (predict()) digit labels for input images.

module8.py
Uses the trained model from le_net.py to classify handwritten digit images.
Takes two arguments:
Image file path.
Expected digit.
Outputs success or failure based on the prediction.

module8.ipynb
Jupyter Notebook demonstrating:
Training the LeNet model.
Saving and loading the trained model.
Testing the model with handwritten digit images.
